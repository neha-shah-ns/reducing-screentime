# Reducing Screen Time for Improved Personal Health 

By: Neha Shah

## Introduction

Excessive screen time has become a significant concern in world that revolves around technology. It affects both physical and mental well-being regardless of age. This project aims to address the problem of high screen time and reduce the average total screen time by at least 2 hours by the end of December. Armed with current insights, recommendations can be provided to help reduce excessive screentime. The end goal is to make an impact on one's personal life by enhancing personal well-being and productivity while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 

| Costs | Benefits |
|------|-----|
|Time spend on collecting data - adds additional time to total screentime | Improve physical and mental health|
| | Enhances productivity|
| | Acheive a healthy work life balance 

There are many benefits associated with reduced screen time compared to costs. While it may be difficult to quantify the benefits, they prove to have significant value in one’s live overtime. 

## Problem & Goal 

Metric of Interest: Total Screen Time – the total time spent on viewing screens 

Problem: My screen time is too high. The average total screen time is 10.54 hours for the last 2 months (October 1st to Nov 30th 2023).

Goal: The goal is to reduce average total screen time by at least 2 hours by the end of December 2023. 

## Data Collection Process 

Screen time is measured by recording the difference between the time an individuals eyes land on a digital screen and the time an individual’s eyes move away from the screen. Screen time is recorded on the apple watch stopwatch. When an individuals eyes land on a digital screen, the stopwatch is started. On the other hand, when an individual’s eyes move away from the screen, the stopwatch is paused. This process is repeated throughout the entire day (24 hours) for each type of screentime. By the end of the day, the total time (in hours) is recorded and summed together. 

The total screen time includes the sum of 5 different types of screen times: 
- Work Screen Time – includes any work laptop and desktops (multiple monitors) 
- Personal Laptop Screen Time – includes any personally owned laptops used at home 
- Phone Screen Time – includes personally owned iPhone  
- Tablet Screen Time – includes personally owned  iPad and Kindle 
- TV Screen Time – includes digital projector and televisions 

*Note the apple watch used to record the data is not considered as a digital device for screentime.

## Analysis 

### Total Screen Time

- On average, total screen time is lowest during Saturday, Sunday and Thursday; highest on Monday, Tuesdays and Wednesdays  
- The lowest screentime was approximately 3.4hrs and highest screentime was 17.4hrs 
- It seems there is no increasing or decreasing trend of total screen time over time

### Total Screen Time By Device

- 40% of screen time is spent on the phone followed by personal laptop and work screens on average
- The lowest screen time spent is on the iPad at 7%

### Activities During Screen Time / Top Used App

- Out of 61 days, most time was spent on social media, studying and texting with the lowest time spent on shopping and facetime 
- The topmost used app was TikTok followed by Netflix. Most of the apps within the topmost used apps were streaming apps.

### Exercise Time, Sleep, Walking Steps

- It appears there is no correlation between total screen time and exercise time and sleep 
- There seems to be some negative correlation between total screen time and walking steps; total steps increases as total screen time decreases 

Over the past 2 months, my average screen time is approximately 11 hours. Aside from work and school, most of my screen time is due to my phone. It appears most of my time is spent on either TikTok or some form of streaming ( Netflix, AppleTv+ etc). There is a moderate negative correlation between my screentime and average steps. Surprisingly, there is no correlation between exercise or sleep and total screen time. More data needs to be collected so that we can analyze trends over an extended period. The effects of excessive screen time often realized gradually over time, so it is important to study trends across a longer timeframe. This can be taken to another level by collecting data for a certain population and analyzing trends of the poulation. This could serve as a baseline for comparing individual trends. 

## Recommendations 

- Introduce a screen limit time on phone apps which cannot be disabled once enabled.
- Introduce daily exercies to lower screen time since there was a correlation between steps and total screentime.
- Continue collecting data once these are implemented.
